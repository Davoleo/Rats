**RatN** is a fork of **[alexThe1666's Rats](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Rats)** for 1.12.2, made for the **[Rebirth of the Night](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rebirth-of-the-night)** modpack. 
Like our other mods and forks, this fork is made by a collaborative effort of the dev team, recruited and/or commissioned mod developers, and community members. Credit goes to **[Davoleo](https://github.com/Davoleo)** for getting the project started! 
Our goal is to give back to the MC modding community by providing as many config options and customization for modpack developers, as well as fixing any bugs that may occur. 
We plan to continue support for 1.12.2 for quite some time.

More changes will follow in the future, and we will update this fork if Alex decides to continue updating the 1.12.2 version of Rats. 
Please make suggestions and make bug reports on our GitHub! Thank you!
